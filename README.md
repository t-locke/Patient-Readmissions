# Patient-Readmissions
Study patient readmission within 60 days of discharge based on age, chronic conditions, and total costs. Using Machine Learning, I want to find out if we can predict when a patient will be readmitted after discharge so that we can better prepare to “take care” of them to minimize any chance from coming back to the hospital (readmission).
